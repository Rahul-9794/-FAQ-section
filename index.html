            What are the differences between Java and JavaScript?
          </h3>

            <p>
              Java: It is one of the most popular programming languages. It is
              an object-oriented programming language and has a virtual machine
              platform that allows you to create compiled programs that run on
              nearly every platform. Java promised, “Write Once, Run Anywhere”.
              JavaScript: It is a light-weighted programming language
              (“scripting language”) for developing interactive web pages. It
              can insert dynamic text into the HTML elements. JavaScript is also
              known as the browser’s language.

          <h3 class="accordion-header">Numeric Types in JavaScript ?</h3>
          <div class="accordion-body">
            <p>
              In JavaScript, numbers play an important role, and understanding
              their behavior is essential for effective programming. Let’s
              explore the various aspects of numeric types in JavaScript

          <h3 class="accordion-header">Number Coercion in JavaScript?</h3>
          <div class="accordion-body">
            <p>
              In JavaScript, coercion refers to the automatic or implicit
              conversion of values from one data type to another. When different
              types of operators are applied to values, JavaScript performs type
              coercion to ensure that the operation can proceed. Let’s explore
              some common examples of coercion.

          <h3 class="accordion-header">Integer conversion?</h3>
          <div class="accordion-body">
            <p>
              Some operations such as those which work with an array, string
              indexes, or date/time expect integers. After performing the
              coercion if the number is greater than 0 it is returned as the
              same and if the number NaN or -0, it is returned as 0. The result
              is always an integer.

          <h3 class="accordion-header">Fixed-width number Conversion?</h3>
          <div class="accordion-body">
            <p>
              In Javascript, there are some functions that deal with the binary
              encoding of integers such as bitwise operators and typedArray
              objects. The bitwise operators always convert the operands to
              32-bit integers.।
